# Tower Blocks Game

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

The **Tower Blocks Game** is a web-based clone of the popular *Stack* game. In this game, players stack blocks as high as possible by aligning them perfectly with the block below. The challenge is to place each new block accurately as the game progresses. The higher you stack the blocks, the faster the game moves, making it more challenging as you go. The goal is to build the tallest tower without dropping a block!
