# Pedro Pedro Meme Replication

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

The **Pedro Pedro Meme Replication** is a fun and interactive project where I recreated the popular "Pedro Pedro" meme using just **HTML** and **CSS**.
This meme, widely shared for its humorous and simple yet catchy text, is now fully replicated in the form of an interactive web page.
By using web technologies like HTML and CSS, I was able to capture the spirit of the meme while providing a smooth, engaging experience for anyone who interacts with it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **HTML5** for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.

## üåê Live Demo
